## 🔴 Mistake 1 — Console Paste Warning

### Problem:

```
You tried to paste code into the Console and saw this message:

"Warning: Don't paste code into the DevTools Console
 that you don't understand or haven't reviewed yourself.
 Please type 'allow pasting' below and press Enter."
```

### Why It Happens:

```
Chrome has a built-in safety feature.
Pasting random code from strangers can allow
hackers to steal your account or data.
Chrome asks you to confirm before allowing paste.
```

### ✅ Fix:

```
STEP 1: In the Console, TYPE THIS YOURSELF (do not paste):

        allow pasting

        Then press ENTER.

STEP 2: You will see this confirmation:
        "Pasting enabled"

STEP 3: Now paste your KeyForge code → press ENTER
```

### ⚠️ Important Rules:

```
❌ Do NOT copy-paste "allow pasting" — type it manually
✅ Always type it yourself using your keyboard

❌ Never paste code from strangers into your console
✅ Only paste your OWN KeyForge code that you have reviewed
```

### Alternative — Use Firefox Instead:

```
Firefox does not show this warning at all.
Simply paste your code → press ENTER → Done!
```

---

## 🔴 Mistake 2 — Content Load Failed Error

### Problem:

```
You entered the correct password but received this error:

"Content load failed.
 Ensure encrypted-content.json exists."
```

### Why It Happens:

```
The browser cannot find the encrypted-content.json file.
This is usually a server or file path issue.
```

### ✅ Fix — All Causes and Solutions:

#### Cause A — No Local Server Running:

```
❌ WRONG: Opened index.html by double-clicking it directly
✅ RIGHT: Run a local server in your terminal:

          npx serve .
          Browser: http://localhost:3000

          OR

          python3 -m http.server 8080
          Browser: http://localhost:8080

          OR

          VS Code → Right-click index.html
          → "Open with Live Server"
```

#### Cause B — JSON File Does Not Exist:

```
❌ WRONG: encrypted-content.json was never created
✅ RIGHT: Create the file first:

          touch encrypted-content.json

          Then generate content from console and paste it in.
```

#### Cause C — File Name Is Incorrect:

```
❌ WRONG file names:
   Encrypted-Content.json    (capital E)
   encrypted_content.json    (underscore instead of dash)
   encryptedcontent.json     (no dash at all)
   encrypted-content.JSON    (capital extension)

✅ CORRECT file name:
   encrypted-content.json    (exactly this, nothing else)
```

#### Cause D — Wrong Path in CONFIG:

```
Check the CONFIG object inside index.html:

❌ WRONG:
   contentFile: 'content.json'
   contentFile: 'data/encrypted-content.json'

✅ CORRECT (if file is in the same folder):
   contentFile: 'encrypted-content.json'
```

---

## 🔴 Mistake 3 — Wrong JSON File Format

### Problem:

```
Password entered → Error shown → Content not visible
Browser console shows: "Unexpected token" or "JSON parse error"
```

### Why It Happens:

```
The encrypted-content.json file has an invalid JSON structure.
This is caused by extra characters, missing brackets,
or an incomplete paste from the console output.
```

### ✅ Fix — Correct vs Incorrect Formats:

#### ❌ WRONG — Placeholder Text Still Present:

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "username": "ADMIN",
      "ciphertext": "GENERATE_THIS_BY_RUNNING_IN_BROWSER_CONSOLE"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### ❌ WRONG — Extra Text Copied Above or Below:

```
[KeyForge] Copy into encrypted-content.json ↓
{
  "users": [ ... ]
}
'{\n  "users": ...'
```

#### ❌ WRONG — Incomplete JSON (Missing Closing Brackets):

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "username": "ADMIN",
      "ciphertext": "U2FsdGVkX1+ekJ..."
```

*Closing brackets `}`, `]`, `}` are missing.*

#### ✅ CORRECT — Exactly This Format:

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "username": "ADMIN",
      "ciphertext": "U2FsdGVkX1+...full ciphertext here..."
    },
    {
      "username": "AGENT_SHADOW",
      "ciphertext": "U2FsdGVkX1/...full ciphertext here..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Validate Your JSON:

```
Go to: jsonlint.com
Paste your JSON content there.

Green result ✅ = Valid format — good to go
Red result   ❌ = Something is wrong — fix the error shown
```

---

## 🔴 Mistake 4 — Opening File Directly

### Problem:

```
You double-clicked index.html to open it.
It opened in the browser but:
→ Password entered → "Content load failed"
→ Or nothing happened at all
```

### Why It Happens:

```
Your browser URL looks like this:
file:///C:/Users/name/project/index.html
↑
"file://" protocol

The fetch() API does not work on the file:// protocol.
The browser cannot load encrypted-content.json this way.
```

### ✅ Fix — Run a Local Server:

#### Option 1 — npx serve (Recommended):

```bash
# In Terminal or Command Prompt:
cd your-project-folder

npx serve .

# Then open in browser:
# http://localhost:3000
```

#### Option 2 — Python:

```bash
cd your-project-folder

python3 -m http.server 8080

# Then open in browser:
# http://localhost:8080
```

#### Option 3 — VS Code Live Server:

```
1. Install VS Code
2. Install extension: "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey
3. Right-click on index.html
4. Click "Open with Live Server"
5. Browser opens automatically ✅
```

#### Option 4 — PHP:

```bash
php -S localhost:8080

# Then open in browser:
# http://localhost:8080
```

### Check Your URL:

```
❌ WRONG: file:///C:/Users/.../index.html
✅ RIGHT: http://localhost:3000
✅ RIGHT: http://localhost:8080
✅ RIGHT: http://127.0.0.1:5500
```

---

## 🔴 Mistake 5 — Placeholder Text Not Replaced

### Problem:

```
The encrypted-content.json file still contains
the original placeholder text:

"GENERATE_THIS_BY_RUNNING_IN_BROWSER_CONSOLE"

Password entered → Decryption fails → Error shown
```

### ✅ Fix — Step by Step:

```
STEP 1: Open index.html in your browser
        (via Live Server — http://localhost:3000)

STEP 2: Press F12 → Click the Console tab

STEP 3: Type "allow pasting" → press ENTER

STEP 4: Paste this code → press ENTER:

KeyForge.generateMultiUser([
  {
    username: "ADMIN",
    password: "your-password-here",
    content: {
      title: "Admin Panel",
      description: "Welcome Admin!",
      sections: [
        {
          heading: "Secret Section",
          body: "Only the admin can see this.",
          tags: ["ADMIN"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]);

STEP 5: A JSON output will appear in the console.
        Copy ONLY this part:

        {
          "users": [ ... ]
        }

STEP 6: Open encrypted-content.json and REPLACE
        the entire existing content with the new JSON.

STEP 7: Save the file → Reload the browser
        → Test login ✅
```

---

## 🔴 Mistake 6 — Password Not Working

### Problem:

```
You entered what you believe is the correct password but:
"Invalid key. 4 attempts remaining."
```

### All Causes and Fixes:

#### Cause A — Extra Space in Password:

```
❌ WRONG: "admin123 "  (trailing space at end)
❌ WRONG: " admin123"  (leading space at start)
✅ RIGHT: "admin123"   (no extra spaces)

Fix: Type the password carefully.
     Copy-pasting often adds invisible spaces.
```

#### Cause B — Caps Lock is On:

```
❌ WRONG: Typing "ADMIN123" when password is "admin123"
✅ RIGHT: Turn off Caps Lock and try again
```

#### Cause C — Different Password Used During Encryption:

```
During generation:
password: "Admin@123"

During login:
password: "admin123"   ← This is DIFFERENT!

Fix: Use the exact same password that was passed
     into generateMultiUser() when encrypting.
```

#### Cause D — JSON File Was Not Updated:

```
You generated new JSON but the old file is still on disk.

Fix: Open encrypted-content.json and check it.
     It should contain a real ciphertext starting with U2FsdGVkX1...
     NOT the placeholder "GENERATE_THIS..." text.
```

#### Cause E — Browser Cache:

```
Fix: Perform a hard reload:
     Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + R
     Mac:           Cmd + Shift + R
```

---

## 🔴 Mistake 7 — KeyForge is Not Defined

### Problem:

```
You typed KeyForge.generateMultiUser() in the Console and got:

"Uncaught ReferenceError: KeyForge is not defined"
```

### All Causes and Fixes:

#### Cause A — Console Opened on the Wrong Page:

```
❌ WRONG: Console opened on about:blank or any other website
✅ RIGHT: Open the console on YOUR KeyForge site

Check: The browser URL must show localhost:3000 or localhost:8080
```

#### Cause B — Page Did Not Fully Load:

```
Fix: Reload the page → Ctrl+R / Cmd+R
     Then try the console command again
```

#### Cause C — CryptoJS Failed to Load:

```
Fix: Open the Network tab (F12 → Network)
     Look for: crypto-js.min.js
     Status should be: 200 OK ✅
     If it shows "Failed" → check your internet connection
     Or self-host CryptoJS locally
```

#### Cause D — Script Tag is Missing from index.html:

```
Check index.html for these two required scripts:

Script 1 (in <head>):
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/
crypto-js/4.1.1/crypto-js.min.js"></script>

Script 2 (before </body>):
<script>
  ;(function KeyForgeAuth() {
    ...
    window.KeyForge = { ... };
  })();
</script>

Both must be present. Neither should be missing.
```

---

## 🔴 Mistake 8 — CryptoJS Failed to Load

### Problem:

```
Console shows:
"CryptoJS is not defined"
OR nothing on the page works at all.
```

### ✅ Fix:

#### Check — Network Tab:

```
F12 → Network tab → Reload the page

Look for: crypto-js.min.js
Status:   200 ✅ = Loaded successfully
Status:   Failed ❌ = There is a problem
```

#### Fix A — Check Your Internet Connection:

```
CryptoJS loads from this CDN:
cdnjs.cloudflare.com

No internet = CryptoJS cannot load
Fix: Connect to the internet and reload the page
```

#### Fix B — Self-Host CryptoJS (For Offline Use):

```
STEP 1: Download the file from:
        https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/
        crypto-js/4.1.1/crypto-js.min.js

STEP 2: Save it in your project folder:
        project/
        ├── index.html
        ├── crypto-js.min.js       ← Place it here
        └── encrypted-content.json

STEP 3: Update the script tag in index.html:

❌ BEFORE (CDN version):
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/..."></script>

✅ AFTER (local version):
<script src="crypto-js.min.js"></script>

Now it works without any internet connection!
```

## 🔴 Mistake 9 — Incomplete JSON Copy

### Problem:

```
The console produced output but you either:
→ Did not copy all of it
→ Accidentally copied extra text along with it
```

### What the Console Actually Shows:

```
The console displays THREE separate things:

LINE 1: [KeyForge] Copy into encrypted-content.json ↓
        ↑ DO NOT COPY THIS — it is just an instruction label

LINE 2: {                            ← COPY THIS
          "users": [                 ← COPY THIS
            { ... }                  ← COPY THIS
          ]                          ← COPY THIS
        }                            ← COPY THIS

LINE 3: '{\n  "users": ...'
        ↑ DO NOT COPY THIS — it is the same JSON as a raw string
```

### ✅ Correct Way — What Exactly to Copy:

```
Copy only this section:

{
  "users": [
    {
      "username": "ADMIN",
      "ciphertext": "U2FsdGVkX1+..."
    },
    {
      "username": "AGENT_SHADOW",
      "ciphertext": "U2FsdGVkX1/..."
    }
  ]
}

Start from the first { and end at the last }.
Not more. Not less.
```

### ✅ Easy Method — Right-Click in Console:

```
In the console output:
→ Click the arrow next to the { } object to expand it
→ OR right-click on the output object
→ Select "Copy object"
→ This copies a perfectly formatted JSON string
```

---

## 🔴 Mistake 10 — Both Files in Different Folders

### Problem:

```
Your files are in separate locations:

Documents/
├── index.html                       ← Here
└── Downloads/
    └── encrypted-content.json       ← Here (WRONG!)
```

### ✅ Fix — Correct Folder Structure:

```
Both files MUST be in the exact same folder:

my-project/
├── index.html                  ← ✅
└── encrypted-content.json      ← ✅ SAME FOLDER

If they are separated:
1. Cut encrypted-content.json
2. Paste it into the same folder as index.html
3. Restart your local server
4. Test again
```

### Verify in Terminal:

```bash
# Navigate into your project folder:
cd my-project

# List all files:
ls -la

# You must see BOTH files:
# index.html
# encrypted-content.json
```

---

## 🔴 Mistake 11 — Auto-Lock Triggering Too Often

### Problem:

```
The site locks itself immediately after login
or after a very short time of inactivity.
```

### Cause:

```
The autoLockSeconds value in CONFIG is set too low.
Default value is 120 seconds (2 minutes).
```

### ✅ Fix — Increase autoLockSeconds:

```javascript
// Find the CONFIG object inside index.html:

const CONFIG = {
  contentFile: 'encrypted-content.json',

  // ❌ WRONG (locks too quickly):
  autoLockSeconds: 10,

  // ✅ CORRECT options — choose what works for you:
  autoLockSeconds: 120,    // 2 minutes  (default)
  autoLockSeconds: 300,    // 5 minutes
  autoLockSeconds: 600,    // 10 minutes
  autoLockSeconds: 0,      // Never auto-lock

  maxAttempts:     5,
  lockoutSeconds:  30,
};
```

### How the Timer Resets:

```
These user actions automatically reset the timer:
→ Moving the mouse
→ Pressing any keyboard key
→ Touching the screen (mobile)
→ Scrolling the page
→ Clicking anywhere

If you are not interacting with the page,
the timer continues counting down.
```

---

## 🔴 Mistake 12 — Not Working on Mobile

### Problem:

```
Everything works correctly on desktop but on mobile:
→ The UI layout is broken
→ The screen zooms in when typing the password
→ Content does not fit the screen properly
```

### ✅ All Fixes:

#### Fix A — Accessing via file:// on Mobile:

```
❌ WRONG: Opened the file directly on mobile
✅ RIGHT: Run the server on your desktop:
          npx serve .

          Both desktop and mobile must be on the same WiFi network.

          Find your desktop's local IP address:
          Windows:   ipconfig → IPv4 Address
          Mac/Linux: ifconfig → inet address

          On mobile browser, open:
          http://192.168.1.XX:3000
          (replace XX with your actual IP)
```

#### Fix B — iOS Safari Zoom Issue:

```
Check the <head> section of index.html for this tag:

✅ This line must be present:
<meta name="viewport"
      content="width=device-width,
               initial-scale=1.0,
               maximum-scale=1.0,
               user-scalable=no" />

Also check the input CSS:
font-size: max(16px, 1rem);

iOS Safari automatically zooms in on any
input field with a font size smaller than 16px.
```

#### Fix C — Content Not Fitting the Screen:

```
Check the auth-panel padding in the CSS.
It must use responsive clamp() values:

✅ CORRECT (responsive):
padding: clamp(20px, 5vw, 44px) clamp(16px, 5vw, 48px);

❌ WRONG (fixed pixels — overflows on small screens):
padding: 44px 48px;
```

## 🟡 Quick Diagnosis Checklist

### Check These First — Takes Only 2 Minutes:

```
SETUP CHECK:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
□ Are index.html and encrypted-content.json in the same folder?
□ Is a local server running? (npx serve . or python3 -m http.server)
□ Does the browser URL show http://localhost:...? (not file://)
□ Is your internet connection active? (needed for CryptoJS CDN)

JSON CHECK:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
□ Does encrypted-content.json contain a real ciphertext?
  (It must start with U2FsdGVkX1...)
□ Is the placeholder text "GENERATE_THIS..." completely removed?
□ Is the JSON format valid? (check at jsonlint.com)
□ Is the file named exactly "encrypted-content.json"?

PASSWORD CHECK:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
□ Are you using the exact same password from generateMultiUser()?
□ Is Caps Lock turned off?
□ Is there no extra space before or after the password?

CONSOLE CHECK:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
□ Are there any red errors in the console?
□ Is there a "KeyForge is not defined" error?
□ Is there a "CryptoJS is not defined" error?
```

---

## 🟢 Correct Setup Order

### First-Time Setup — Follow This Exact Order:

```
STEP 1: Create your project folder
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

mkdir my-keyforge-site
cd my-keyforge-site

STEP 2: Place both files in the same folder
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

my-keyforge-site/
├── index.html                ← Full KeyForge HTML code goes here
└── encrypted-content.json    ← Leave empty for now

STEP 3: Start a local server
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

npx serve .
→ Open browser: http://localhost:3000

STEP 4: Open the browser console
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Press F12 → Click the Console tab

STEP 5: Enable pasting
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Type this manually in the console:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Paste your KeyForge.generateMultiUser([...]) code
Press ENTER

STEP 7: Copy the output
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Copy ONLY the { "users": [...] } JSON object
Do NOT copy the "[KeyForge] Copy into..." label line

STEP 8: Paste into the JSON file
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Open encrypted-content.json
Replace the entire content with your new JSON
Save the file

STEP 9: Test your setup
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Reload the browser: Ctrl+R / Cmd+R
Enter your password → Click AUTHENTICATE
Your content should appear ✅
```

[1] Terminal:  cd your-project-folder
[2] Terminal:  npx serve .
[3] Browser:   Open http://localhost:3000
[4] Press F12: Console tab → type "allow pasting" → ENTER
[5] Console:   Paste KeyForge.generateMultiUser([...]) → ENTER
               Copy { "users": [...] } → Paste into JSON file → Save
               Reload browser → Test your password ✅

Still not working after all that?
→ Validate your JSON at jsonlint.com
→ Look for red error messages in the browser console
→ Double-check all file names are spelled exactly correctly
→ Make sure both files are in the same folder
```

## 🧪 Test Credentials Reference

```
After running generateMultiUser() with the example code:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  USERNAME       │  PASSWORD    │  EXPECTED RESULT   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ADMIN          │  admin123    │  ✅ Unlocks         │
│  AGENT_SHADOW   │  shadow456   │  ✅ Unlocks         │
│  ADMIN          │  wrongpass   │  ❌ Denied          │
│  ADMIN          │  shadow456   │  ❌ Denied          │
│  (anything)     │  (blank)     │  ⚠️ Empty error     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Cross-access test:
Using AGENT_SHADOW's password on ADMIN = ❌ Denied
This proves AES-256 encryption is working correctly.

## 🔐 Security Reminders

```
✅ DO:
→ Use passwords with 12+ characters
→ Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols
→ Store your password in a password manager
→ Keep a backup of your original plaintext content
→ Test on both desktop and mobile after setup

❌ DO NOT:
→ Use simple passwords like "admin123" in production
→ Share your password in plain text via email or chat
→ Paste unknown code into your browser console
→ Lose your original plaintext content with no backup
→ Use KeyForge for highly sensitive legal or medical data
